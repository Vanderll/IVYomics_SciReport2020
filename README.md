# IVYomics_NatComm2019

This respository has all code used for analyses condcuted and reported on in Johnson et al, 2019.  The code consists of everything from pre-processing raw data to the final analysis.

Please note: once a statistical model was performed, the results file was copied to a local drive in order to make R markdown reports in R studio.

The probesFromPipeline.Rdata is a list of the CpGs that passed our filtering steps using the full cohort (including islet antibody cases and controls that were not included in this paper).
